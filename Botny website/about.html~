		<h1>The Botny team</h1>
		<p>The Botny team is comprised of three students enrolled in the Electronics & Computer Engineering Technology - Renewable Energy program at Camosun College: Logen De Bruyne, Mohamed Kurani, and Chris Perrier. Our goal is to provide the pleasure and accessibility of having an automated garden within your home. We are doing so utilizing aeroponics, enabling you to save time and money while drastically reducing your ecological footprint.</p>
		<p>We would like to thank Mel Dundas, Wayne Mayes, Pat Nicholson, and Camosun College for providing assistance and funding for our project. We would also like to thank you for taking an interest in our project. We are excited to make a product that could better people on an individual level and as a community.</p>
